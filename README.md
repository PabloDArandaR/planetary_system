# Planetary System

The purpose of this project consists of generating an app that allows to set up a a planetary system with given masses, radius, and initial positions. The first version of this project will consist only of the calculation of the results, with no visual representation. On a second version, a 2D visualization will be included. The third version shall include 3D, and later improvement will allow moving spatially through the simulation.

## Units used

* **Mass**: kilograms
* **Distances**: meters
* **Time**: seconds
